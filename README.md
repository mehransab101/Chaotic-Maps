# Chaotic-Maps
all the chaotic maps that exist ( i have listed them in two different text files)

one is a list of chaotic maps that you can find a wikipedia information article and the other one is a list of all the maps that you cannot find information on them using wiki.

the 3rd text file is a list of all the fractals that we know.
